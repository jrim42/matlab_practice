% class time?
% extra team practice:
    % 1) ocean pCO2 matrix data comparison/correlation
    % 2) atmospheric data (PM, AOD etc...) comparison/correlation
    % 3) dust and CO2(or chlorophyll) data comparison/correlation

% toolbox: pre-installed useful functions (some are GUI available)
    % path must be designated accurately (home > set path)
    % and function must exist in "the path"

% matrix calculation
    % element-wise
    % flipping matrix: flip, flipud, fliplr
    % transpose, reshape
% size of matrix: size and length

% colon and semi-colon
% end: last element
% seperately saving variables on workspace
% data format
% 'print' is for saving file into specific file format

% string functions: C-based functions and more (ex. strcmpi)

% observing devices have unique error code (errno)

% other calculations
    % cell, floor, round, fix
    % diff

% function handle
